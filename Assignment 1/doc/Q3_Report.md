## Frequency Distribution of Number of Hops

Number of hops could not be found for all servers except Google. 

---
## Frequency Distribution of Latency

Latency could not be found for all servers except Google.  
In case of Google, it can be observed that more number of hops caused more latency (except for 2 cases).

---
## ISPs peered with Google

All the traceroute servers (Canada, Germany, NZ, SA, Sweden, UK) that we have used are peered to Google. This can be said from the fact that the hop that goes out from ISP of the traceroute server takes very less hops (< 3) to reach Google.

---
## Mobile Network ISP

No destination could be reached from our mobile network's (JIO mobile network) ISP. So we could not find number of hops and latency for any of the destination.
